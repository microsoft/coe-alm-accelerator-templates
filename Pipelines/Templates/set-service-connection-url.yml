#This template will default the ServiceConnectionUrl to the ServiceConnection variable supplied in a deployment pipeline for backward compatibility
#The July 2022 release includes the ability for a single service connection to be used for multiple environments rather than requiring a service connection
#per environment. This update provides the ability to specify a ServiceConnection (i.e. the Power Platform Service Connection Name to use for the deployment)
#and a ServiceConnectionUrl on the deployment pipeline and leverages the BuildTools.EnvironmentUrl to dynamically set the environment url for a given service connection.
